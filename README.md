##This is the client side of **OddMarket**, our 3rd project for Ironhack's Web Development Bootcamp

OddMarket is an ecommerce mockup that sells products that are slightly *peculiar*, or in other words, that nobody ever asked for. It uses Stripe's payment API in order to be able to simulate a real transaction.
